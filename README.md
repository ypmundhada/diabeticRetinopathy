# diabeticRetinopathy
Application of Deep Learning in Retinal Imaging
Detected Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using Deep Learning techniques on the EyePACS dataset
Model trained on fundus images of patients with diabetes to detect DR, and graded them as non-DR,
mild Non-Proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR or Proliferative DR
The model architecture involved Convoluted Neural Networks (CNNs)
Gained sufficient exposure working with TensorFlow, Keras, InceptionV3, and Medical Image Processing.
